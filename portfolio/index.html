            <p>
            
             My journey into web development began at the age of 15, and it was a story of curiosity, trial, and pure fascination. Like most teenagers, I spent a lot of time online, browsing websites and playing games. <br> It wasn't long before I decided to dig deeper. Armed with nothing but a desire to understand and a few basic tutorials, I started learning HTML and CSS. The moment I saw my first web page come to life on my screen, I was hooked. I was amazed at how I could control every element on the page—from text and images to layout and design—just by writing a few lines of code. That feeling of creation, of making something tangible from nothing, was like magic to me.
